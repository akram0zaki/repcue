# RepCue Consent Management System

## Overview

RepCue implements a robust, privacy-first consent management system that respects user privacy while providing a seamless fitness tracking experience. The system is designed to be GDPR-compliant, transparent, and user-centric.

## Purpose and Objectives

### Core Purpose
The consent system serves multiple critical functions:

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensures adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations
- **User Privacy**: Gives users complete control over their data and how it's used
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicates what data is collected and why
- **Trust Building**: Establishes trust through clear, honest data practices
- **Graceful Degradation**: App remains functional even without data storage consent

### Key Principles

1. **Privacy by Design**: Data protection is built into every aspect of the system
2. **User Control**: Users have granular control over different types of consent
3. **Transparency**: Clear, jargon-free explanations of data usage
4. **Reversibility**: Users can revoke consent at any time
5. **Future-Proof**: Versioned system allows for regulatory changes

## Consent Types and Granularity

### Essential Consent
- **Purpose**: Basic app functionality
- **Data**: Exercise preferences, timer settings
- **Storage**: Local device only
- **Required**: Yes (app won't function without this)

### Analytics Consent
- **Purpose**: App improvement and performance monitoring
- **Data**: Usage patterns, performance metrics (anonymized)
- **Storage**: Local aggregation only
- **Required**: No (optional)

### Marketing Consent
- **Purpose**: Feature updates and fitness tips
- **Data**: User preferences for communications
- **Storage**: Local preferences only
- **Required**: No (optional)

## Consent Versioning System

### Version History

#### Version 1 (Legacy)
```typescript
interface ConsentV1 {
  hasConsented: boolean;
  timestamp: string;
}
```

#### Version 2 (Current)
```typescript
interface ConsentV2 {
  version: 2;
  timestamp: string;
  hasConsented: boolean;
  cookiesAccepted: boolean;
  analyticsAccepted: boolean;
  marketingAccepted: boolean;
  dataRetentionDays: number;
}
```

### Migration Strategy
- **Automatic Migration**: Old consent data is automatically upgraded
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy data is preserved during migration
- **Failure Handling**: Malformed data triggers fresh consent request
- **User Notification**: Users are informed when migration occurs

## Regulatory Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ **Lawful Basis**: Clear consent for data processing
- ✅ **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected
- ✅ **Purpose Limitation**: Data used only for stated purposes
- ✅ **Storage Limitation**: Configurable retention periods
- ✅ **Right to Withdraw**: Easy consent revocation
- ✅ **Right to Erasure**: Complete data deletion capability
- ✅ **Transparency**: Clear privacy information

### CCPA Compliance
- ✅ **Consumer Rights**: Right to know, delete, and opt-out
- ✅ **Data Disclosure**: Clear information about data collection
- ✅ **Opt-Out Rights**: Easy mechanisms to refuse data sale (N/A - no data sales)

### Other Regulations
- **Privacy Act**: Compliant with Australian Privacy Principles
- **PIPEDA**: Aligned with Canadian privacy requirements
- **Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)**: Brazilian data protection compliance

## User Control and Experience

### Consent Banner Features
- **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't block app functionality unnecessarily
- **Clear Choices**: "Accept All" and "Essential Only" options
- **Detailed Information**: Expandable privacy details
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant, keyboard navigable
- **Mobile Optimized**: Responsive design for all devices

### Settings Integration
- **Real-Time Control**: Change consent preferences anytime
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status of current consent settings
- **Data Export**: Download personal data in JSON format
- **Complete Reset**: Nuclear option to clear all data and consent

## Design and Architecture

### Service-Oriented Design
The consent system is implemented as a singleton service (`ConsentService`) that:

- Manages all consent-related operations
- Provides a clean API for the rest of the application
- Handles persistence and migration automatically
- Emits events for consent changes

### Key Components

#### 1. ConsentService
```typescript
class ConsentService {
  // Core consent management
  hasConsent(): boolean
  setConsent(data: ConsentData): void
  revokeConsent(): void
  
  // Granular consent checking
  hasAnalyticsConsent(): boolean
  hasMarketingConsent(): boolean
  
  // Migration and versioning
  getConsentStatus(): ConsentStatus
  migrateConsentData(): void
  
  // Data management
  resetConsent(): void
  reloadConsentData(): void
}
```

#### 2. ConsentBanner Component
- React component for consent collection
- Responsive design with accessibility features
- Integrated with ConsentService for state management

#### 3. Storage Integration
- All storage operations check consent before proceeding
- Graceful degradation when consent is not given
- Automatic cleanup when consent is revoked

### Data Flow

```
User Interaction → ConsentBanner → ConsentService → localStorage
                                       ↓
Application Components ← Consent Status ← Event Emission
```

## Implementation Details

### Consent Storage
```typescript
const CONSENT_STORAGE_KEY = 'repcue_consent';

// Storage format in localStorage
{
  "version": 2,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-23T10:30:00.000Z",
  "hasConsented": true,
  "cookiesAccepted": true,
  "analyticsAccepted": false,
  "marketingAccepted": false,
  "dataRetentionDays": 365
}
```

### Migration Logic
1. **Load existing data** from localStorage
2. **Check version** against current version
3. **Apply migrations** sequentially if needed
4. **Validate result** for data integrity
5. **Fallback to reset** if migration fails

### Error Handling
- **Malformed Data**: Triggers fresh consent request
- **Storage Errors**: Graceful degradation to memory-only mode
- **Migration Failures**: Automatic reset with user notification
- **Network Issues**: Local-first approach unaffected

## Privacy-First Features
