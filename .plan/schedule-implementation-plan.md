# RepCue: Workout Schedule Feature Specification and Implementation Plan

## Overview

Extend the application to support **user-defined workout schedules**.

* A **schedule** maps selected weekdays to **workouts**.
* A **workout** consists of one or more **exercises**.
* Each exercise is either:

  * **Repetition-based** (e.g. 3 sets √ó 12 reps), or
  * **Time-based** (e.g. 1 minute)
* The exercise type is defined by a fixed attribute in the **exercise catalog**.
* Each exercise also has a **recommended default** value from the catalog.
* When adding exercises to a workout, users may override the defaults with their own custom values (e.g. change 30s to 1m, or 3√ó12 to 4√ó10).

## Impact on the Application

### üß≠ Navigation

* The bottom navigation bar will now contain:

  1. **Home**
  2. **Schedule** (new)
  3. **Exercises**
  4. **Timer**
  5. **Log**
  6. A visually separated **‚ãÆ icon** for overflow
* Tapping the **‚ãÆ icon** reveals a **popover** containing a single `"Settings"` option.
* Tapping `"Settings"` opens the Settings page.

### üè† Home Page

* Existing layout remains intact.
* A new section will appear **above the existing content** to reflect the user's schedule status:

  * If a schedule exists:

    * A two-line ‚ÄúUpcoming Workout‚Äù block is shown:

      * Line 1: `"Upcoming Workout"`
      * Line 2:

        * Left: weekday name (e.g. **Wednesday**) in large font, with date below (e.g. **Jul 2**)
        * Right: `"Start Now"` button
  * If **no schedule exists**:

    * Show a call-to-action button labeled **"Add Workout"**

### üìÖ Schedule Page

* Accessible via the **new tab in the navigation bar**.
* If no schedule exists:

  * Display a button: **"Add Schedule"**
* If a schedule exists:

  * Show a list of days with associated workouts.
  * Each listed workout has an **edit** option.
* A **schedule** is a mapping of one or more **weekdays** to **workouts**.
* A **workout** is a sequence of one or more **exercises**.
* This screen may become dense with information, so the UI should be:

  * Intuitive
  * Scrollable by day
  * Clear and easily editable

### ‚ûï Add Schedule Page

* Accessible via:

  * ‚ÄúAdd Schedule‚Äù on the Home page or Schedule page
* Flow:

  1. Select **weekday**
  2. Add **exercises**, one at a time
  3. For each added exercise:

     * Default values from the catalog are pre-filled
     * User can customize values (e.g. duration or sets √ó reps)

### ‚è± Timer

* The existing **standalone timer** remains fully functional:

  * Launchable via:

    * Timer tab
    * ‚ÄúStart Timer‚Äù on Home
    * ‚ÄúStart Timer‚Äù in Exercise catalog
* With the introduction of workouts:

  * The Timer must now support **repetition-based exercises**.
  * If invoked as part of a scheduled workout:

    * Use the **existing timer circle** for set/rest timing
    * Add an **outer circle or progress indicator** to reflect **repetition progress** (e.g. 5 / 12 reps)
    * This outer progress appears **only for repetition-based exercises**, and only in **guided workout mode**, not standalone

### üìä Log Page

* Logs will continue to show:

  * Standalone timers
  * New: **completed workouts**
* For each logged **workout**:

  * Provide a way to **expand/collapse** to view:

    * Exercises performed
    * Custom values (duration or reps)
    * **Completion percentage** per exercise (if incomplete)

### ‚öô Settings Page

* Introduce new configurable defaults tied to schedules and workouts:

  * Example: **default rest duration** between exercises
* All new defaults should:

  * Have **sensible pre-filled values**
  * Be editable by the user

## üì¶ Data Model Changes

* Extend the **Exercise model**:

  * Add attribute: `exercise_type` (`time-based` or `repetition-based`)
* Add new models/entities:

  * **Schedule** (weekday ‚Üí workout mappings)
  * **Workout** (list of ordered exercises, optional labels)
  * **WorkoutExercise** (specific instance of an exercise in a workout, with user-defined overrides)
* Logging model updates:

  * Log a WorkoutSession

    * With completion stats per exercise
    * Timestamp and actual values recorded

## Additional Considerations

* **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent creating two workouts for the same weekday.
* **Edge Case Handling**: If a user taps "Start Now" but the workout is empty or misconfigured, show an alert.
* **User Guidance**:

  * First-time tooltips for Schedule tab
  * "No schedule? Add one now!" prompts
* **Animations**: Smooth transitions between exercises, countdowns, and rest periods enhance flow.
* **Dark Mode Compatibility**: Maintain visual consistency across modes.
