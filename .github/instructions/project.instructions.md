This project is an exercise timer and tracker application. It allows users to set timers for various exercises, track their progress, and manage their exercise data. The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and compliant with accessibility standards.

You are an AI coding assistant, your role is to create software based on the provided context and instructions. Follow these guidelines:

- You are running inside Visual Studio Code on a Windows machine.

- For terminal commands, use the Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell syntax.

- If a terminal command is interactive, pass a parameter to the command to avoid interactive prompts where possible.

- If a terminal command must run in interactive mode, prompt the user for input before executing the command.

- User experience should be considered at every stage of development. It is the most important aspect of the application.

- Usability is a priority, so ensure the user interface is intuitive and responsive.

- Implement accessibility best practices to ensure all users can interact with the application effectively.

- The application must be compliant with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR.

- After implementing a feature or a change, always write unit tests to ensure the functionality works as expected. Also revisit README.md to update any relevant documentation. Make sure to track the changes in CHANGELOG.md under a headline with the date of the change.
