## üö® Critical Issues Found

### Issue #1: Date Calculation Error in Workout Scheduling
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Home Screen Workout Panel  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**: 
- Created workout for Tue and Fri
- Home screen shows "next exercise Tue 25-Aug" instead of correct "Tue 26-Aug"
- Date calculation appears to be off by 1 day

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Should show correct next workout date (Tue 26-Aug)

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. On Monday 25-Aug, create workout for Tuesday and Friday

### Issue #2: Exercise Videos Not Playing in Workout Mode
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workout Mode Video Playback  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**:
- Created workout with Plank, Burpees, Finger Rolls

- "Show Exercise Demo Videos" toggle was enabled
- Videos work in standalone mode initially
- After completing workout, videos stop working in standalone mode
- Thin green line appears on timer component (UI artifact)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Videos should play in workout mode when toggle enabled
- Videos should continue working in standalone mode after workout
- No UI artifacts on timer component

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Create workout with exercises that have videos (Plank, Burpees)
2. Enable "Show Exercise Demo Videos" toggle
3. Start workout mode
4. Observe videos not playing
5. Complete workout
6. Try standalone exercise mode - videos broken

**Root Cause**: Workout mode video integration issue + possible state management problem

### Issue #3: Missing Arabic Translation
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: Internationalization (i18n)  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**:
- "Cancel" label is not translated in Arabic locale files
- Missing translation key causing fallback to English

**Expected Behavior**:

### Issue #4: Passkey Sign-Up Failure
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: WebAuthn Authentication  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**:
- Sign-up with biometrics fails with error "Failed to send a request to the Edge Function"
- Complete Phase 1.1 feature not working

**Expected Behavior**:
- Passkey sign-up should work smoothly with biometric authentication

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Navigate to sign-up page
2. Enter email address
3. Click "Sign up with biometrics" button
4. Observe Edge Function error

**Root Cause**: Edge Function connectivity or configuration issue

### Issue #5: Console Logging Infinite Loop
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: App Initialization  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**:

  - "üöÄ Initializing app with consent granted"
  - "üöÄ Initializing PWA capabilities..."
  - "üîß Service worker not registered in development mode"
  - Settings loading messages

**Expected Behavior**:
- App should initialize once and stop logging repeatedly

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Open app in any browser
2. Open developer console
3. Observe continuous logging loop

**Root Cause**: App initialization cycle issue, possibly related to consent/settings state management

### Issue #6: Cross-Browser Authentication Failure
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Authentication System  
**Status**: üî¥ Open  

**Description**:
- Signed up on Firefox with email/password successfully

- Same credentials should work across all browsers

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Sign up on Firefox with email/password
2. Open Edge browser
3. Try to sign in with same email/password
4. Observe authentication failure

**Root Cause**: Session/cookie sharing issue or Supabase client configuration

- Simultaneously got red error toast: "Sync failed Sync endpoint error: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code"
- Console showing endless loop messages
- Mixed success/failure state causing confusion

**Expected Behavior**:
- Clean magic link authentication
- Successful migration without sync errors
- No conflicting success/error messages

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Use magic link authentication
2. Observe migration banner (success)
3. Observe sync error toast (failure)
4. Check console for logging issues

**Root Cause**: Sync service failure after successful migration + console logging loop
