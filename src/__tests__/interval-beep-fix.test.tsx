/**
 * Interval Beep Fix - Integration Test
 * 
 * This test verifies that interval beeps work correctly during timer execution.
 * 
 * MANUAL TESTING PROCEDURE:
 * 1. Start the app and navigate to Timer page
 * 2. Select any time-based exercise (e.g., Push-ups)
 * 3. Set duration to 30 seconds
 * 4. Ensure sound is enabled in settings
 * 5. Set interval duration to 5 seconds in settings
 * 6. Start the timer
 * 7. Verify that beeps play at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 seconds
 * 
 * FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
 * - Added rest start/end audio feedback for better workout guidance
 * - Fixed rep-based exercise UI to show smooth progression instead of seconds
 * - Fixed workout mode rest period logic to properly transition between sets
 * - Added comprehensive audio cues for all timer events
