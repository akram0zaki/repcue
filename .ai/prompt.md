Recently I started paying attention to fitness and exercise. I am in my forties and I thought it's probably about time to try and build muscle mass before I enter my fifties and make it part of my routine. I go to the gym once a week and I train Aikido once a week. I also started exercising at home, which I like a lot.  However I am crazy about timing, benchmarking, and keeping record. For example I do the plank and while doing it I don't look at the time and I wonder how long I've been doing it. I thought it would be helpful to have some sort of a beeper that would beep at intervals. If the interval is 30 seconds then the beeper would sound once after the first thirty seconds, twice after the second, and so on. It would also keep track of the date and time it was triggered and log that in an activity log.  But then it can go beyond being just a beeper, and into an exercise tracker that would also capture which exercise I did.  

But there are so many exercises out there, and for me usability is paramount. So I need to make sure that I can easily select which exercise I am doing when I am setting the timer, or afterwards, out of probably thousands of exercises. Maybe I can have favorite exercises on speed dial?

Usability is the most important aspect for this page/app. It should be very simple and easy to use. For example while exercising my hands will probably be shaky, then I need the UI to be easy to use with big icons and minimal clicks to get things done.

I intend to offer this page to family and friends, so it would need some sort of profile identifier to be able to persist the activity and link it to the profile. Perhaps I can start with a cookie stored on the user's device as an identifier, and later introduce email OTP as form of authentication.

I like to start with a web page, beating in mind that if I like it then I would bundle it as android/ios apps. This should be taken into account for the choice of technology.

Once I start using this page/app I will have ideas for additional features so the design and architecture should allow for extensibility.

Give me a thorough critique of this exercise tracker idea, how to improve it, and how to go about implementing it. I would also appreciate suggestions for an app name that would be appealing to gen-x and gen-y users which are unique and don't resemble existing apps or sites which offer the same service.

The application must comply with European Union regulations where applicable, e.g. ask for consent before storing the cookie, be compliant with the European Accessibility Act, etc.

I want your feedback in the canvas in markdown format.

Give me a detailed implementation plan as a new markdown file in canvas that I can feed into an ai coding assistant to build the application for me.

Make sure the plan includes wireframes, implementation phases, and acceptance criteria for each phase. Add instruction to include unit and integration tests to verify the acceptance criteria for each phase.
The plan should also include the design and architecture, wireframes, recommended technology stack that meets current and future requirements, and breakdown of each phase into tasks with unique task-id for each.

Make sure the plan covers the compliance with applicable EU regulations like cookie consent and accessibility act.

1. Set the structure to easily switch between both databases where needed, but start with implementing the one which is more compatible with a raspberry pi 5.
2. Start with a small list of exercises, but with option to include more in future phases.
3. Implement a simple banner for consent, it should block access until the user accepts the cookie.
4. Interval should be configurable under settings menu in the application but the default should be 30 seconds.
5. Out of Vite, Create React App, or Next.js for the React setup, you choose the best technology that is most fit for purpose, provides beter extension in the future into mobile apps, and would run nicely on raspberry pi 5.
6. Create a clean minimal design that upholds the mobile-first principle, with big buttons for ease of use while exercising.

Implement a feature for a countdown before the timer starts. The countdown duration is configurable on the settings page in a slider that allow the user to select a value between 0 and 10.
The pre-timer countdown allows the user to get into position for the exercise before the timer starts.

---

on every exercise listing there is a number of tags displayed, if they're more than two tags then there is a +n tag displayed next to them. Currently there is no way on the UI to expand or see what additional tags are there. What is the best way, from usability and user experience perspective, to be able to show the additional tags?

Don't make any changes yet, just give me your proposal to tackle this and ask for my confirmation before implementation.

---

Create a PWA implementation plan to provide a truly native-like experience across all platforms. Walk me through the plan before implementing it.

---

Further detail the implementation plan into trackable modules and tasks and write it to the .plans/ directory as pwa-implementation-plan.md . This file will be used to track progress on the implementation.

---

Implement the changes in Module 1
Ask questions if you need more information.

---

I have switched to branch dev-pwa to implement these changes. update the pwa implementation plan with the current progress, update changelog and readme, then commit and push changes to the dev-pwa branch before we proceed to implementing the next module.
