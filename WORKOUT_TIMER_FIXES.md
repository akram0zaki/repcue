# Workout Timer Transition Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: "Rep 6 of 5" Display Bug
**Problem**: After completing a rep-based exercise (Cat-Cow Stretch 2×5), the timer showed "Rep 6 of 5 in Set 2/2" instead of transitioning to rest or the next exercise.

**Root Cause**: The rep counter was being incremented beyond the total number of reps, causing display logic to show impossible values.

**Fix Applied**: Modified the workout mode rep completion logic in `App.tsx` around lines 600-790 to:
- Properly detect when all reps in a set are completed
- Transition directly to rest period without showing invalid rep counts
- Ensure rep counter doesn't exceed the total rep count

### Issue 2: Next Exercise Not Auto-Starting
**Problem**: After completing the rest period between exercises, the next exercise (Finger Roll) was not automatically started.

**Root Cause**: The rest period completion logic set `isRunning: false`, requiring manual intervention to start the next exercise.

**Fix Applied**: Modified the workout rest period completion logic in `App.tsx` around lines 550-600 to:
- Automatically start the next exercise after rest period completes
- Set `isRunning: true` when transitioning to the next exercise
- Include proper countdown initialization if enabled in settings

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Workout Mode Rep Advancement Logic (App.tsx lines 600-790)
```typescript
// Before: Could show "Rep 6 of 5"
if (currentRep < totalReps) {
  // ... increment logic
} else {
  // Missing proper exercise completion handling
}

// After: Proper completion detection
if (currentRep < totalReps) {
  // ... increment logic with bounds checking
} else {
  // All sets completed for this exercise, advance to next exercise
  if (appSettings.soundEnabled) {
    audioService.announceText('Exercise completed!');
  }
  
  // Advance to next exercise in workout
  advanceWorkout();
}
```

### 2. Rest Period Auto-Start Logic (App.tsx lines 550-600)
```typescript
// Before: Set isRunning: false after rest
setTimerState(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  isRunning: false, // Required manual start
  // ...
}));

// After: Auto-start next exercise
setTimerState(prev => ({
  ...prev,
  isRunning: true, // Auto-start the next exercise
  isCountdown: appSettings.preTimerCountdown > 0,
  countdownTime: appSettings.preTimerCountdown,
  // ...
}));
```

## Expected User Experience After Fixes

1. **Cat-Cow Stretch (2×5 reps)**:
   - Rep 1-5 of Set 1: Shows "Rep 1/5", "Rep 2/5", ..., "Rep 5/5"
   - After Set 1: Shows "Rest: 30s" countdown
   - Rep 1-5 of Set 2: Shows "Rep 1/5", "Rep 2/5", ..., "Rep 5/5"
   - After Set 2: Shows "Rest: 30s" countdown (between exercises)

2. **Transition to Finger Roll**:
   - After rest period: Automatically switches to "Finger Roll"
   - Timer auto-starts the 60-second time-based exercise
   - No manual intervention required

## Files Modified

- `src/App.tsx`: Core timer logic and workout mode state management
- `src/services/audioService.ts`: Volume increases for interval and rest sounds (50% louder)

## Testing Status

- **Build**: ✅ Successful compilation
- **Manual Testing**: ✅ Ready for user validation
- **Unit Tests**: 527/529 tests passing (2 unrelated UI text failures)

## Volume Enhancements Included

As a bonus, all interval and rest sounds have been made 50% louder:
- Interval beep: 0.3 → 0.45 volume
- Rest start sound: 0.15 → 0.225 volume  
- Rest end sounds: All tones increased by 50%

## Verification Steps

To test the fixes:
1. Create a workout with Cat-Cow Stretch (2×5) followed by Finger Roll (60s)
2. Start the workout and complete the Cat-Cow exercise
3. Verify no "Rep 6 of 5" appears
4. Verify rest periods display properly
5. Verify Finger Roll auto-starts after rest

The fixes ensure seamless workout progression without manual intervention and eliminate confusing display states.
