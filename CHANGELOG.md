# RepCue - Fitness Tracking App Changelog

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added (Video Demos Phase 0)
- Video demo groundwork behind feature flag: introduced `VIDEO_DEMOS_ENABLED` (default `true`) plus per-user setting `showExerciseVideos` (default `true`) with accessible toggle in Settings ("Show Exercise Demo Videos").
- Media metadata domain types: `ExerciseMedia` & `ExerciseMediaIndex` for strongly‑typed mapping of exercise IDs to available video variants (square / portrait / landscape) including `repsPerLoop` & `fps`.
- Media loader utility `loadExerciseMedia()` providing single in‑memory cached fetch of `exercise_media.json` with defensive filtering and cache clear helper.

### Internal
- Extended `AppSettings` & `DEFAULT_APP_SETTINGS` with `showExerciseVideos` preference (graceful default preserves existing users). No persistence schema migration required.
- Added feature flag module `src/config/features.ts` keeping video capability trivially disableable at build/runtime.
- Added `src/utils/loadExerciseMedia.ts` (no-store fetch to avoid stale metadata; narrows list to valid objects; returns map keyed by exercise id) prepared for later variant selection logic.
- Updated `SettingsPage` UI to surface toggle while feature still inert (no Timer UI integration yet) ensuring early user control & respecting future reduced-motion fallbacks.

### Quality
- All 559 tests still passing post Phase 0 (no behavioral change to timer, workouts, or persistence). Zero regression risk accepted before proceeding to Phase 1.
- Security: No remote / third-party URLs embedded; loader fetches only local `exercise_media.json` (mitigates SSRF / injection vectors). No autoplay started yet—video elements not rendered until future phases.

### Rationale
- Ships the minimal, reversible slice required for safe incremental rollout of exercise demo videos without touching critical timer logic—establishing contract types & user opt-out path before UI integration.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- Per-exercise repetition duration via optional `repDurationSeconds` field on `Exercise`. Timer now uses `(exercise.repDurationSeconds || BASE_REP_TIME) * repSpeedFactor` for all rep-based timing paths (standalone & workout), preserving identical semantics while enabling finer control for faster/slower movements (e.g., burpees at 3s, others at 2s).
- `hasVideo` flag (default `false`) added to every exercise to prepare for future instructional media integration without schema migration overhead.

### Internal
- Refactored `App.tsx` to remove hardcoded rep duration calculations that previously used only `BASE_REP_TIME`; unified logic so every rep-based interval derives from the exercise definition, ensuring workout transitions, rest periods, and activity logging all remain consistent.
- Updated TypeScript `Exercise` interface and seed catalog; existing stored favorites remain intact because merge logic preserves user-specific metadata while adopting new fields.

### Quality
- Full test suite (559 tests) still passing post-refactor; no behavioral regressions detected in rep/set advancement, workout transitions, or logging.
- Backward compatible: exercises lacking `repDurationSeconds` automatically fall back, requiring no data migration.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-11

### Chore
- Post-merge housekeeping and lint/test stabilization
  - Router: Extracted non-component utilities (`preloadCriticalRoutes`, `createRouteLoader`) from `LazyRoutes.tsx` into `router/routeUtils.tsx` to satisfy `react-refresh/only-export-components`
  - ESLint: Replaced remaining `any` types with `unknown` in services (`syncService`, `queueService`), fixed `prefer-const`, and removed unused `eslint-disable` directives in tests
  - Test updates: Adjusted `LazyRoutes.test.tsx` to import `createRouteLoader` from `routeUtils`; removed unnecessary Router nesting and aligned labels earlier in timer tests
  - Lint status: 0 errors, a few non-blocking `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings remain for future tuning
  - Test status: 50 files, 559 tests passing

### Docs
- Updated local developer notes for deployment and housekeeping workflow

## [Latest] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Workout Mode Timer Bug**: Fixed rep-based exercises stopping after 1 rep in workout mode instead of continuing through all reps and sets
  - **Root Cause**: `startActualTimer` function was clearing `workoutMode` state for all exercises (standalone and workout), causing workout exercises to lose their rep/set tracking context
  - **Solution**: Modified timer state logic to preserve `workoutMode` during workout execution and only clear it for standalone exercises
  - **Impact**: Rep-based exercises in workouts now properly advance through all reps (e.g., 1→2→3→4→5) and sets, with rest periods between sets as designed
- **Fixed Rep-Based Exercise Set Progress Display**: Corrected inconsistency between progress bar and text display for completed sets
  - **Issue**: Progress bar showed completed sets while text showed current set number, causing user confusion
  - **Solution**: Updated text display logic to consistently show "X of Y sets completed" matching the progress bar behavior
  - **Impact**: Both progress indicators now accurately reflect the number of completed sets throughout the exercise
- **Fixed Missing Activity Log for Rep-Based Exercises**: Rep-based exercise completions are now properly logged to Activity Log
  - **Issue**: Standalone rep-based exercises (like Cat-Cow Stretch) weren't creating activity log entries upon completion
  - **Solution**: Added activity logging to the rep-based exercise completion branch with proper duration calculation and completion notes
  - **Impact**: All exercise completions now appear in Activity Log with duration and rep/set details

### Technical Changes
- **App.tsx**: Modified `startActualTimer` and countdown functions to preserve `workoutMode` state instead of clearing it unconditionally
  - Changed `workoutMode: undefined` to `workoutMode: prev.workoutMode || undefined`
  - Added debug logging to timer completion logic for workout mode troubleshooting
- **App.tsx**: Added activity logging for standalone rep-based exercise completion with duration calculation and descriptive notes
- **TimerPage.tsx**: Updated set progress text display logic to show completed sets consistently:
  - During rest: Shows `currentSet + 1` completed sets (correct)
  - Set complete but not resting: Shows `currentSet + 1` completed sets (correct)  
  - Working on current set: Shows `currentSet` completed sets (fixed from currentSet + 1)
- **Test Files**: Updated all rep-based exercise tests to match new "X of Y sets completed" format across multiple test files

### Added
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for workout mode timer completion to help diagnose rep/set advancement issues
- **Rep-Based Exercise Completion Logging**: Added proper activity log creation for standalone rep-based exercises with calculated duration and completion details

## [Previous] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Fixed Milliseconds Display in Timer**: Time display now shows only whole seconds (e.g., "00:17") instead of decimal seconds (e.g., "00:17.313") across all timer modes
  - **Root Cause**: `formatTime` function was displaying raw decimal seconds without flooring to whole numbers
  - **Solution**: Added `Math.floor()` to seconds calculation in `formatTime` function to ensure clean time display
  - **Impact**: Affects all timer displays - standalone timers, workout mode, rest periods, and countdown timers
- **Improved Exercise Type Detection**: Fixed timer interval logic to correctly identify exercise type in workout mode context, ensuring time-based exercises use 1000ms intervals and rep-based exercises use 100ms intervals for smooth animation
- **Fixed Red Color Timer Display**: Corrected timer color logic to only show red color during countdown phase (when countdown time ≤ 10 seconds), not during normal exercise timing

### Technical Changes
- Updated `formatTime` function in TimerPage.tsx: Changed `const secs = seconds % 60;` to `const secs = Math.floor(seconds % 60);`
- Updated `startActualTimer` function in App.tsx to properly determine exercise type in workout mode by checking the current workout exercise instead of relying on `selectedExercise`
- Added dependency `exercises` to `startActualTimer` callback to ensure proper exercise type detection
- Enhanced timer color conditional logic in TimerPage.tsx to restrict red color to countdown phase only

### Added
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test coverage for time formatting fix
  - **Format Time Tests**: Validates Math.floor() fix for decimal seconds across multiple scenarios
  - **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests 59.999 seconds, minute boundaries, large values, NaN handling
  - **Workout Mode Tests**: Ensures proper time formatting in workout context and rest periods
  - **Countdown Tests**: Validates countdown timer formatting without decimals

## [Previous] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Timer Bug**: Fixed smooth rep progress animation that only worked on first rep
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple timer interval creation points were using inconsistent timing logic
  - **Solution**: Created centralized `createTimerInterval` helper function for consistent timer behavior
  - **Fixed 6 Timer Creation Points**: Main timer start, rep advancement (standalone + workout), rest-to-next-set transitions (3 instances)
  - **Smooth Animation**: Rep-based exercises now use 100ms intervals with decimal seconds for smooth circular progress
  - **Performance**: Time-based exercises continue using 1000ms intervals for optimal performance

### Added
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created focused test suites for recent changes
  - **Timer Logic Tests**: `smooth-rep-animation-unit.test.ts` - 8 passing tests for timer interval logic
  - **Icon Integration Tests**: `svg-icons-integration.test.tsx` - Tests for SVG icon consistency and theming
  - **Test Coverage**: Validates decimal seconds calculation, interval timing, and cleanup behavior

### Technical Improvements
- **Timer Helper Function**: `createTimerInterval(startTime, isForRepBasedExercise)` centralizes timer creation logic
- **Consistent Timing**: All rep-based exercise timers now use smooth 100ms intervals throughout all reps and sets
- **Code Deduplication**: Eliminated duplicate timer interval creation code across multiple locations
