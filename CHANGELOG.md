## 2025-09-01 (4)

- UX: Exercises page now uses multi-select category tags instead of dropdown, allowing users to filter by multiple categories simultaneously. Layout matches Activity Log for consistency.

## 2025-09-01 (3)

- UX: Home page exercises count is now a clickable link that navigates to Exercises page, moved up to replace Browse Exercises button for better discoverability and reduced UI redundancy.
- docs: Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with monorepo-aware architecture guide, essential commands, and development context for AI coding assistants.

## 2025-09-01 (2)

## 2025-09-01 — iOS Timer video playback fixes

### Fixed
- Exercise demo videos not rendering on iOS Safari in Timer (standalone and workout) while preview worked:
  - Switched to <video> with <source> children (ready for multi-codec fallback). Current assets are WebM-only; the utility emits a single <source> for the chosen URL and will prefer MP4 on iOS when MP4 variants are added.
  - Layering: ensure the video sits above the SVG progress ring (z-index fix) and set the ring to `pointer-events: none` to avoid intercepting taps.
  - Gating: default `show_exercise_videos` to “on” when undefined and remove duplicate checks so gating is: feature flag + user setting + reduced motion.
  - Reload: call `video.load()` when the resolved video URL changes so iOS re-evaluates the `<source>` list.
  - Diagnostics: compact console log for reasons a Timer video is hidden, to aid on-device verification.

### Changed
- Exercise preview modal now also uses the same multi-source pattern for parity and future-proofing.

### Notes
- Only WebM assets are currently shipped; the utility will prefer MP4 on iOS when/if MP4 variants are added, while keeping WebM as a fallback.
- Security/privacy: media remains same-origin; no third-party calls. Respects reduced-motion.

### Build
- Frontend build successful after changes (`pnpm -C apps/frontend build`).

### Related files
- Updated: `apps/frontend/src/pages/TimerPage.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/pages/ExercisePage.tsx`
- Added: `apps/frontend/src/utils/videoSources.ts`

## 2025-08-31

### Fixed
- Mobile dropdowns (Settings → Beep Interval and Language) flashing closed on Safari/Edge mobile.
  - Root cause: focus was being moved to the PWA install banner after its animation, which blurs native pickers on touch devices; and an outside-click handler could also react to native picker taps.
  - Changes:
    - InstallPrompt: safe focus management — do not steal focus on touch devices or while a form control is focused.
    - Navigation dropdown: switch outside-close listener from mousedown → click and ignore events originating from form controls (select/input/textarea/combobox).
  - Result: Native select pickers remain open and usable on mobile.

### Tests
- Added regression unit test ensuring InstallPrompt does not steal focus on touch or when a select is active (`InstallPrompt.focus.test.tsx`). Test execution intentionally skipped per request during this pass.

## 2025-08-31

- docs(sync): Added comprehensive sync architecture and developer guide at docs/sync/READM.md and linked from README.

## 2025-08-31

- Hybrid favorites sync (Phase 1):
  - Store favorites in `user_preferences.favorite_exercises` (TEXT[] of built-in exercise IDs/slugs).
  - Stop syncing `exercises` table for built-in catalog; favorites toggle updates preferences and reflects locally without marking exercises dirty.
  - Added Dexie logic to merge favorites into `getExercises()` so UI reflects cross-device state after sync.
  - Migration: `supabase/migrations/20250831_alter_user_preferences_favorites_to_text_array.sql` changes column type to TEXT[] with safe default.
  - Next phases will seed canonical UUIDs for built-ins and migrate to a normalized `user_favorites` join.

### Firefox settings sync hardening + code hygiene

#### Fixed
- Server-to-browser settings sync now reliably applies on Firefox and other browsers without requiring reload:
  - Immediate theme application during pull and on `sync:applied` events (no flash, respects reduced motion).
  - Beep volume, sound/vibration toggles, pre‑timer countdown, show exercise demo videos, and data auto‑save now reflect server values cross‑device.
  - Forced full pull when critical tables (`user_preferences`, `app_settings`) are missing locally, even if a cursor exists.
  - Singleton deduplication on pull ensures exactly one row for `user_preferences` and `app_settings`.
  - Conflict resolution: server wins by `updated_at` with special rule preferring server when it has `owner_id` and local does not.

#### Changed
- Lint/type hygiene: removed unused variables and eliminated `any` in core services (`storageService`, `syncService`, `authService`) and tests; ESLint passes clean.
- Build validated after changes; unit tests were intentionally skipped for this QA pass per instruction.
 - Settings page: added a "Sync now" button under Data section to trigger bidirectional sync on demand (useful for testing/troubleshooting).
 - Sync scheduler: reverted skip window back to 30 seconds (from 3 seconds) to limit unnecessary traffic and respect user data plans.

#### Notes
- UX: Settings changes propagate within seconds via visibility-triggered sync and debounced scheduling.
- Security: No secrets added; follows OWASP guidance. All network paths use HTTPS; no third‑party calls.

## 2025-08-30 (14) - Dexie v8 migration: index workout_id + normalization hardening

### Fixed
- SchemaError during pre-sync normalization caused by missing `activity_logs.workout_id` index. Added Dexie v8 migration to index `workout_id` and refactored normalization to use scan/filter fallbacks, preventing crashes on existing installs before v8 applies.

### Added
- Test `src/__tests__/storage-indexes.test.ts` to assert `where('workout_id')` works without throwing when IndexedDB is available.

### Notes
- Existing users will be upgraded automatically on next app load. The fallback logic ensures pre-v8 databases won’t crash normalization.

## 2025-08-30 (13) - Phase 2 complete (duration alignment) + Phase 3 diagnostics/resilience

### Fixed
- Duration semantics unified: workout_session.total_duration now always matches the summed per‑exercise duration used in the workout activity log. Eliminates mismatches caused by divergent calculations.

### Added
- Shared duration utility: `apps/frontend/src/utils/workoutDuration.ts` exposes `computeExerciseDuration` and `computeWorkoutDurations` used by `App.tsx` for both session logging and activity logs (single source of truth).
- Diagnostics and resilience for sync:
  - Feature flag `SYNC_USE_INVOKE` (default false) to toggle between Supabase `functions.invoke` and direct `fetch` to `/functions/v1/sync`.
  - Enhanced invoke diagnostics and automatic fallback to direct fetch on failures.
  - Debounced `scheduleSync` to coalesce rapid triggers and reduce "already in progress" noise.
  - Visibility trigger: a `visibilitychange` listener schedules a sync when the app becomes foregrounded.
- Tests: `apps/frontend/src/utils/__tests__/workoutDuration.test.ts` validates duration computations and totals.

### Changed
- `App.tsx` now uses `computeWorkoutDurations(...)` to build the workout session and the per‑exercise activity log entries, ensuring consistent totals and making the logic easier to reason about.
- `syncService`: central `callSyncEndpoint` chooses invoke vs direct fetch via the new feature flag; retains 401 refresh+retry path and emits `sync:applied` on success. Added debounce + visibility foreground scheduling.

### Ops / CI
- Test toggle available: existing SKIP_UNIT_TESTS env is respected in Vitest configs and scripts to temporarily bypass unit tests during manual QA.

### Notes
- Related files: `apps/frontend/src/App.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/services/syncService.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/utils/workoutDuration.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/utils/__tests__/workoutDuration.test.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/config/features.ts`.

## 2025-08-29 (9) - Auth sign-out hardening, skip-link UX, sync 401 retry

### Fixed
- Sign-out reliability: local auth/session state now clears even if server sign-out returns 401/403/404. Prevents users from getting “stuck” when the token is already invalid. Also clears any sync error banners post sign-out.
- Sync 401 handling: when the sync endpoint responds with 401 (Invalid/expired token), the client refreshes the session and retries once with the new access token before surfacing an error.

### Changed
- Accessibility skip link: “Skip to main content” is now hidden by default and only becomes visible after the first Tab keypress to reduce visual noise for pointer users. It remains visible in test environments for a11y assertions.

### Notes
- Related files: `apps/frontend/src/services/authService.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/services/syncService.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/components/AppShell.tsx`.

## 2025-08-30 (10) - IndexedDB schema cleanup (Dexie v7)

### Fixed
- Fresh installs after deleting the database were still creating legacy camelCase tables (activityLogs, userPreferences, appSettings, workoutSessions). Added Dexie version 7 migration to drop these legacy stores so only snake_case tables are present going forward.

### Added
- Unit test `storage-legacy-drop.test.ts` to assert legacy stores are absent and snake_case stores exist on a fresh DB.

### Notes
- Related files: `apps/frontend/src/services/storageService.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/__tests__/storage-legacy-drop.test.ts`.

## 2025-08-30 (11) - Activity Log name backfill + Create Workout seeding

### Fixed
- Activity Log entries missing `exercise_name` are now backfilled at save-time, read-time hygiene, and pre-sync validation. UI no longer shows "undefined" and prefers the actual workout name for workout entries.
- After a fresh DB reset, the Create Workout page could claim "All exercises have been added" due to an empty catalog. We now auto-seed the exercise catalog on first load and show a clearer empty-state with a Retry.

### Added
- `storageService.ensureExercisesSeeded()` helper to populate the catalog when empty.
- Unit test `CreateWorkoutPage.seed.test.tsx` validating the picker lists seeded exercises.

### Notes
- Related files: `apps/frontend/src/services/storageService.ts`, `apps/frontend/src/pages/CreateWorkoutPage.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/pages/__tests__/CreateWorkoutPage.seed.test.tsx`, `apps/frontend/src/pages/ActivityLogPage.tsx`.

## 2025-08-30 (12) - Testing Guide Documentation

### Added
- New comprehensive testing guide at `docs/testing/README.md` covering setup, when to write unit vs integration vs E2E, state/auth/sync/storage considerations, and exact pnpm commands for Windows and CI.

### Notes
- References existing configs: `apps/frontend/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/frontend/vitest.stable.config.ts`, `apps/frontend/playwright.config.ts`, and `apps/frontend/src/test/setup.ts`.

## 2025-08-23

### Package Manager Migration
- Migrated from npm to pnpm for improved performance and disk usage
- Updated all workspace scripts to use `pnpm --filter` syntax
- Added `packageManager` field to root `package.json` (pnpm@10.15.0)
- Updated GitHub Actions CI to use pnpm with action-setup and frozen lockfile
- Fixed TypeScript build errors by adding `@types/node` dependency
- All build, lint, and test commands now work with pnpm

### Repo reorganization (monorepo)
- Split workspace into `apps/frontend` (Vite + React), `apps/backend` (Express + PM2), and `packages/shared` (placeholder for shared types/constants).
- Moved Cypress E2E to `tests/e2e` with its own workspace package.
- Updated root scripts to target workspaces; added `dev:be` for backend.
- Backend now serves `apps/frontend/dist` in production.
- Helper scripts updated to new paths (splash, verify-media, favicons).
- Frontend `.env` moved to `apps/frontend/.env` (VITE_ prefix required).

### Fixed
- Activity Log page flicker: decoupled initial fetch from stats recalculation to prevent re-render loops; stats now recompute when logs or language change without triggering loading state.

- Tests: Align default Vitest config with stable mode to eliminate flakiness between `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:stable`.
  - Updated `vitest.config.ts` to use single-fork pool with `fileParallelism: false`, `isolate: true`, and auto‑mock cleanup settings matching `vitest.stable.config.ts`.
  - Hardened `src/test/setup.ts` to wrap `window.dispatchEvent` only once and avoid recursive wrapping that caused stack overflows under parallel workers.
  - Result: Both `npm run test:unit` and `npm run test:stable` pass 100% locally (64 files, 599 passed, 3 skipped).

## 2025-08-22

- Tests: Fix unit test failures caused by temporal dead zone in hooks/components.
  - Reordered `useCallback` declarations before effects that depended on them in `src/App.tsx`, `src/pages/ActivityLogPage.tsx`, `src/hooks/useInstallPrompt.ts`, and `src/components/InstallPrompt.tsx`.
  - Result: `npm run test:unit` now passes 100% locally (64 files, 599 passed, 3 skipped).

- Fix: Exercise preview now shows a warning toast and fallback panel when a video fails to load (e.g., exercise marked `hasVideo = true` but media missing). Also records consent-aware telemetry for preview video errors.
- UX: Prevent modal from opening if media is missing via 1s HEAD precheck; only the bottom snackbar appears. Timer inline video remains silent (debug logged) to avoid intrusive UI.
- Tests: Hardened preview tests: Router+Snackbar wrappers, jsdom media play stubs, resilient role-based assertions. ActivityLogPage tests updated for case-insensitive button queries and robust empty-state matching.

- Test: Stabilized sequential Vitest runs; added isolation guards in `src/test/setup.ts` (auto-consent, localStorage/indexedDB mocks, window/document restoration), jsdom-safe audio/vibration cleanup, background sync guards, preview modal timing fixes, and video element error handling. Added `docs/devops/testing-practices.md` to document structure and best practices.

## 2025-08-21 (i18n Arabic fixes and UX polish)

### Fixed / Updated
- Home tagline localized via `home.tagline` (ar, ar‑EG) and wired in `HomePage.tsx`.
- Workouts listing: exercise count uses pluralized key in `common` namespace and Arabic now renders correctly; duration uses localized minute/second suffixes (`minutesShortSuffix`, `secondsShortSuffix`).
- Create/Edit Workout: weekday chips now use `weekdayAbbrev.*` (consistent across pages); added Arabic short forms in `ar` and `ar‑EG`.
- Create/Edit Workout: Arabic copy revised to use "البرامج" consistently instead of "التمارين" (name label, create/edit/delete/paused/save, empty states, errors) for both `ar` and `ar‑EG`.
- Arabic pluralization for `workouts.scheduledPerWeek_*` completed (zero/one/two/few/many/other) to prevent English fallback when selecting 2+ days.
- Exercises page: tags treated as an enumeration; added `exercises.tags.{...}` across all locales (en, ar, ar‑EG, de, es, fr, nl) and UI now reads from the exercises namespace.
- Category labels localized in Exercises (section headers) and exercise selectors (Timer page).
- Activity Log:
  - Localized category chips and empty-state category name; fixed Hand Warmup mapping.
  - Dates/times now formatted with active locale; durations use localized suffixes.
  - Exercise names localized; favorite exercise name in stats localized.
  - Localized legacy notes (stopped/completed sets+reps/completed time) with new `activity.status.*` keys.

### Developer notes
- Added/adjusted locale keys across: `public/locales/*/common.json` and `public/locales/*/exercises.json`.
- Updated `EditWorkoutPage.tsx`, `CreateWorkoutPage.tsx`, `WorkoutsPage.tsx`, `ExercisePage.tsx`, `TimerPage.tsx`, and `ActivityLogPage.tsx` to consume the new keys.

- Result: Navigation tests assert translated labels instead of raw keys; still avoids HTTP backend fetch in jsdom.

### ✅ ADDED: Exercise Locales Coverage Guard
- New unit test: `src/__tests__/exercise-locales-coverage.test.ts`.
  - Ensures every locale `public/locales/{lng}/exercises.json` includes all exercise IDs from English.

  - Skips meta keys (e.g., `_meta`) and the `variable` label when iterating exercise IDs.
- Purpose: Prevent silent translation regressions across supported languages.

### ✅ UPDATED: Arabic Labels (ar, ar‑EG) — Workouts vs Exercises
- Clarified bottom navigation labels to avoid ambiguity:
  - `navigation.workouts` → "البرامج"
  - `navigation.exercises` → "التمارين"

  - `workouts.title` and `workouts.backToWorkouts` now reference "البرامج".
- Files updated: `public/locales/ar/common.json`, `public/locales/ar-EG/common.json`.

### ✅ UPDATED: Exercise Localization Integration
- Fixed `localizeExercise` to target the correct `exercises` namespace (keys are `${id}.name/description`) and avoid collisions with `common.exercises.*` UI keys.
- Localized `ExercisePage` search and display:
  - Search now matches localized exercise name/description while keeping tag search stable.
  - Cards render localized name, description, and ARIA labels.
  - Duration formatter returns localized "Variable" label via `t('exercises.variable')`.
- Tests: Added `localizeExercise-unit.test.ts` to validate fallback and namespaced translation behavior.

### ✅ ADDED: Exercise Localization Documentation
- **Docs**: Added `docs/i18n/exercise-localization.md` outlining the full strategy for localizing the built-in exercise catalog and future user-generated exercises.
- **Index**: Updated `docs/i18n/README.md` with quick links.
- **Highlights**: i18n resource structure (`public/locales/{lng}/exercises.json`), UI helper (`localizeExercise`), UGC translation model, testing plan, and OWASP-aligned security notes.

### ✅ COMPLETED: Navigation Menu Localization

- Established systematic pattern: `t('common:common.section.*')` → `t('section.*')` and `t('common:common.weekday.*')` → `t('weekday.*')`
- Updated locale structure with proper nested namespaces: `common`, `settings`, `timer`, `weekday`, `home`, `workouts`, `activity`, `exercises`
- All critical pages compile cleanly with TypeScript and follow modern i18n best practices

## 2025-08-19

- Testing: Restore Vitest threaded parallel execution in default config for faster runs. Add `vitest.stable.config.ts` and `npm run test:stable` for single-threaded, forked mode on Windows/CI when needed. Docs updated in README.

## 2025-08-19

### Fixed
- Exercises page: corrected i18n keys for exercise type badges so localized text renders (Time-based / Rep-based) instead of raw keys. Added a unit test to prevent regressions.

## 2025-08-18

### Added
- Completed Phase 4 of i18n: localized remaining UI (CreateWorkout, ActivityLog, EditWorkout) using nested keys (common:common.*) with pluralization and ARIA labels.

### Changed
- Expanded `public/locales/en/common.json` with workouts and activity sections; mirrored keys in test seed.
- Replaced literals in `src/pages/EditWorkoutPage.tsx` with i18n keys.

### Testing
- Full unit suite green after changes (57 files, 582 tests passed, 3 skipped).

# RepCue - Fitness Tracking App Changelog

## [Latest] - 2025-08-17 (Internationalization Phase 4 UI Instrumentation – Workouts & Exercises)

### Added
- English locale keys for Workouts (`common.workouts.*`) and Exercises (`common.exercises.*`) including pluralization and ARIA labels.
- Test resource seeding in `src/test/setup.ts` for new keys to avoid HTTP backend fetch during unit tests.

### Changed
- Instrumented `WorkoutsPage.tsx` with i18n: titles, buttons, empty states, consent gate, tooltips, exercise count pluralization, delete confirmation, and scheduled days fallback.
- Instrumented `ExercisePage.tsx` (main + ExerciseCard): header/subtitle, search and filters, category options, favorites toggle, results count, empty state, type badges, default values, tags controls, and start timer button.

### Notes
- Remaining Phase 4: Create/Edit Workout pages and Activity Log instrumentation.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-17 (Internationalization Phase 3 RTL & Detection)

### Changed
- Language detection refined: prioritizes persisted choice (localStorage) → system language (navigator) → html tag.
- Automatic application of HTML `lang` and `dir` attributes based on current language.
- Added `body.rtl` toggle for Arabic to aid RTL-specific styling when needed.

### Added
- Unit tests verifying `lang/dir` updates and `rtl` class toggling with persistence.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-17 (Internationalization Phase 2 Init)

### Added
- Internationalization (i18n) initialization wired without user-visible changes:
  - i18next + react-i18next setup with LanguageDetector and HttpBackend (`src/i18n.ts`, imported in `src/main.tsx`).
  - English base locale scaffolded at `public/locales/en/` with `common.json`, `a11y.json`, and `titles.json`.
  - Minimal non-critical usage: accessibility strings in `AppShell` now use `t()`.
  - Smoke test added to validate initialization.

### Notes
- No behavior change for users yet; groundwork for future locale additions.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-17 (Internationalization Phase 1 Docs)

### Added
- Internationalization (i18n) Phase 1 design artifacts:
  - `docs/i18n/string-inventory.md`
  - `docs/i18n/key-styleguide.md`
  - `docs/i18n/rtl.md`
  - `docs/i18n/tech-choice.md`

### Notes
- No runtime code changes yet. These documents define the contract for Phase 2 wiring.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-13 (Video Demos Phase 5 E2E Enhancements)

### Added
- Cypress E2E coverage for exercise demo videos: render path, user setting toggle (off -> on), reduced motion suppression, and global feature flag disabled scenario.
- Feature flag override mechanism: window.__VIDEO_DEMOS_DISABLED__ used in tests to assert fail-closed behavior without rebuilding.
- New test ids: nav-more, onboarding-flow, browse-exercises to stabilize navigation & gating flows.

### Changed
- Refactored settings navigation in tests to use existing More menu instead of hidden test-only button (removed nav-settings-direct hook).
- Feature flag module now supports runtime disable override (no impact in production paths unless explicitly set by tests).

### Fixed
- Flaky consent/onboarding gating by seeding consent prior to app load in E2E environment (deterministic initial state).
- Video test now reliably targets Bicycle Crunches (only seeded exercise with hasVideo=true) preventing false negatives when first card lacks media.

### Security / Privacy
- Override path restricted to local test harness via window global; production users have no UI to set it (fail-safe default true maintained).

---

## [Latest] - 2025-08-13

### Fixed
- Production occasionally missing `exercise_media.json` (served HTML at /exercise_media.json → JSON parse error, blocking demo videos). Root cause: file absent during build on Pi; Vite only copies existing public/ assets.

### Added
- `scripts/verify-media.mjs` pre/post build guard: verifies presence, attempts recovery from legacy `src/data/` if needed, copies into `dist/` when missing, logs actionable diagnostics.
- Enhanced `loadExerciseMedia()` diagnostics: logs HTTP status, content-type, and response snippet when parsing fails for faster root-cause analysis (e.g., 404 HTML fallback).

### Reliability
- Prevents silent production regressions; graceful UI degradation retained (videos optional) while surfacing clear console warnings.

### Security
- No external sources introduced; still same-origin fetch only (mitigates SSRF). Defensive parsing avoids leaking full HTML, truncates snippet.

### Video Demos Phase 4 (Settings & Telemetry) – Completed 2025-08-13
- Settings toggle (`Show Exercise Demo Videos`) + global `VIDEO_DEMOS_ENABLED` flag confirmed functional gating.
- Added consent-aware local telemetry (`recordVideoLoadError`) capturing failed demo video loads (same-origin `/videos/` only, max 50 entries, analytics consent required) with zero network transmission; aids cleanup of stale media references.
- Updated `useExerciseVideo` to log bounded telemetry on `error` events without impacting user experience or autoplay gating.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Completed (Video Demos Phase 3)
- T-3.1 Graceful fallback: `useExerciseVideo` sets an error flag on load failure; `TimerPage` hides the video element when `error` is present (no layout shift, ring-only experience maintained).
- T-3.2 Runtime caching: Workbox `runtimeCaching` rule for `/videos/*.(mp4|webm|mov)` using `StaleWhileRevalidate` (cache `exercise-videos-cache`, 60 entries / 30 days) for faster warm playback & offline resilience.
- T-3.3 Prefetch optimization: During pre-countdown or workout rest the app injects `<link rel="prefetch" as="video">` for the next (or imminent) exercise’s best-fit variant, cutting initial playback delay.

### Added
- Integration test (`TimerPage.videoPrefetch.test.tsx`): asserts prefetch link appears in countdown & simulated rest scenarios.
- Fallback unit test retained (skipped placeholder) plus updated hook tests; total tests now 569 passed / 1 skipped (570).

### Internal
- `TimerPage` prefetch effect with idempotent cleanup (`data-ex-video` attribute) avoids duplicate hints and removes tag on dependency change/unmount.
- Show-logic updated to include `!exerciseVideo.error` guard (prevents flashing failed element).

### Quality
- Full suite: 53 files, 569 passing, 1 skipped (post-prefetch) – no timer/workout regressions.
- Security: Prefetch limited to same-origin `/videos/` URLs (no user-controlled input → mitigates SSRF / cache poisoning). Runtime caching likewise scoped.
- Performance: Anticipatory fetch + SW cache synergy should reduce perceived start latency for successive exercises, especially on Pi / mobile networks.

### Rationale
- Phase 3 closes the resilience + performance layer: errors are silent, media is cached, and upcoming assets are opportunistically fetched to keep workouts fluid.

### Next (Phase 5 preview)
- Add offline video playback E2E scenario & long-loop drift validation.
- Optionally tighten act() warnings in several TimerPage tests (non-functional noise).

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Completed (Video Demos Phase 2)
- T-2.1 Circular in-ring video rendering (previous commit).
- T-2.2 Rep loop synchronization: loop boundary now emits a pulse animation on outer rep ring via `onLoop`; gating prevents playback during rest/countdown ensuring visual motion only during active movement.
- T-2.3 Start/stop policy refinements: video playback gated by new `isActiveMovement` (running & not resting & not countdown); automatic seek-to-start + loop detector baseline reset on stop/reset for consistent restarts.

### Added
- Hook option `isActiveMovement` separating raw `isRunning` from movement state for precise gating.
- Unit tests: extended `useExerciseVideo.test.tsx` to cover (1) variant selection (API updated), (2) inactivity gating when `isActiveMovement=false`, (3) reset behavior ensures `currentTime` resets.

### Internal
- Refactored `TimerPage` ordering to compute rest state early and avoid forward references; consolidated visibility logic into `showVideoInsideCircle` excluding rest periods.
- Ensured no side effects on authoritative rep advancement (pulse purely presentational).

### Quality
- Test suite count: 567 tests passing (added 2 new tests net). No regressions in timer, workout, or storage flows.
- Accessibility: Motion suppressed during rest and countdown; respects reduced motion preference (feature fully disabled in that case).

### Rationale
- Phase 2 closes with stable, feature-gated visual enhancement providing immediate instructional context without altering timing semantics, setting a clean foundation for Phase 3 caching & fallbacks.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added (Video Demos Phase 2 - Partial)
- TimerPage circular video integration: conditional `<video>` rendered inside progress ring with circular crop, subtle overlay for contrast, and viewport-responsive variant selection (recomputed on resize).
- Playback gating tied to: global feature flag, user setting (`showExerciseVideos`), reduced motion preference, timer running state (suppressed during pre-countdown), and exercise `hasVideo` field.

### Internal
- Utilized existing `useExerciseVideo` hook for metadata resolution & loop detection; added resize listener to update variant without reloading page.
- Graceful fallback: if media JSON fetch fails in test/Node environment, logs warning and proceeds with ring-only UI (all tests still green).
- Placeholder loop boundary handler registered (rep sync visual pulse will be implemented in T-2.2).

### Quality
- Full suite still passes: 565/565 tests (no new tests added this sub-phase; UI change is non-breaking and feature gated).
- Accessibility: respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; video muted + `playsInline` to avoid autoplay policy issues.

### Rationale
- Delivers visual enhancement safely behind toggles before wiring rep counter synchronization (next sub-task), enabling early UX review without altering core timer mechanics.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added (Video Demos Phase 1)
- Video variant selector utility `selectVideoVariant` choosing optimal asset (portrait / landscape / square) based on viewport aspect ratio with graceful fallback order.
- `useExerciseVideo` hook (Phase 1 contract) providing:
  - Metadata resolution & variant selection (square->portrait->landscape fallback) from `ExerciseMediaIndex`.
  - Loop boundary detection via `timeupdate` wrap-around (handlers registered through `onLoop`).
  - Playback gating using global feature flag, user setting, reduced-motion preference, and timer run/pause signals.
  - Reduced-motion auto-disable (WCAG friendly) – no video playback when `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`.
  - Ready/error state signaling without throwing (graceful degradation).
- Initial unit tests:
  - `selectVideoVariant-unit.test.ts` (aspect selection + fallbacks)
  - `useExerciseVideo.test.tsx` (metadata absence/presence, variant resolution)

### Internal
- Hook designed intentionally UI-agnostic; no TimerPage modifications yet, ensuring zero user-facing change pending Phase 2 integration.
- Defensive error handling: playback `play()` promise rejection logged (autoplay policy) instead of propagating; prevents uncaught errors during timer operations.
- Security: only static JSON-derived paths used; no dynamic code evaluation; honors user motion preferences (privacy/respect for accessibility settings).

### Quality
- Test suite increased from 559 to 565 passing tests (+6) confirming non-regressive addition.
- No existing snapshots or timer behavior altered; all rep/time logic untouched.

### Rationale
- Establishes stable abstraction boundary so upcoming Phase 2 (TimerPage circular video integration) can focus purely on UI/visual layering & rep sync without reworking media plumbing.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added (Video Demos Phase 0)
- Video demo groundwork behind feature flag: introduced `VIDEO_DEMOS_ENABLED` (default `true`) plus per-user setting `showExerciseVideos` (default `true`) with accessible toggle in Settings ("Show Exercise Demo Videos").
- Media metadata domain types: `ExerciseMedia` & `ExerciseMediaIndex` for strongly‑typed mapping of exercise IDs to available video variants (square / portrait / landscape) including `repsPerLoop` & `fps`.
- Media loader utility `loadExerciseMedia()` providing single in‑memory cached fetch of `exercise_media.json` with defensive filtering and cache clear helper.

### Internal
- Extended `AppSettings` & `DEFAULT_APP_SETTINGS` with `showExerciseVideos` preference (graceful default preserves existing users). No persistence schema migration required.
- Added feature flag module `src/config/features.ts` keeping video capability trivially disableable at build/runtime.
- Added `src/utils/loadExerciseMedia.ts` (no-store fetch to avoid stale metadata; narrows list to valid objects; returns map keyed by exercise id) prepared for later variant selection logic.
- Updated `SettingsPage` UI to surface toggle while feature still inert (no Timer UI integration yet) ensuring early user control & respecting future reduced-motion fallbacks.

### Quality
- All 559 tests still passing post Phase 0 (no behavioral change to timer, workouts, or persistence). Zero regression risk accepted before proceeding to Phase 1.
- Security: No remote / third-party URLs embedded; loader fetches only local `exercise_media.json` (mitigates SSRF / injection vectors). No autoplay started yet—video elements not rendered until future phases.

### Rationale
- Ships the minimal, reversible slice required for safe incremental rollout of exercise demo videos without touching critical timer logic—establishing contract types & user opt-out path before UI integration.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-12

### Added
- Per-exercise repetition duration via optional `repDurationSeconds` field on `Exercise`. Timer now uses `(exercise.repDurationSeconds || BASE_REP_TIME) * repSpeedFactor` for all rep-based timing paths (standalone & workout), preserving identical semantics while enabling finer control for faster/slower movements (e.g., burpees at 3s, others at 2s).
- `hasVideo` flag (default `false`) added to every exercise to prepare for future instructional media integration without schema migration overhead.

### Internal
- Refactored `App.tsx` to remove hardcoded rep duration calculations that previously used only `BASE_REP_TIME`; unified logic so every rep-based interval derives from the exercise definition, ensuring workout transitions, rest periods, and activity logging all remain consistent.
- Updated TypeScript `Exercise` interface and seed catalog; existing stored favorites remain intact because merge logic preserves user-specific metadata while adopting new fields.

### Quality
- Full test suite (559 tests) still passing post-refactor; no behavioral regressions detected in rep/set advancement, workout transitions, or logging.
- Backward compatible: exercises lacking `repDurationSeconds` automatically fall back, requiring no data migration.

## [Latest] - 2025-08-11

### Chore
- Post-merge housekeeping and lint/test stabilization
  - Router: Extracted non-component utilities (`preloadCriticalRoutes`, `createRouteLoader`) from `LazyRoutes.tsx` into `router/routeUtils.tsx` to satisfy `react-refresh/only-export-components`
  - ESLint: Replaced remaining `any` types with `unknown` in services (`syncService`, `queueService`), fixed `prefer-const`, and removed unused `eslint-disable` directives in tests
  - Test updates: Adjusted `LazyRoutes.test.tsx` to import `createRouteLoader` from `routeUtils`; removed unnecessary Router nesting and aligned labels earlier in timer tests
  - Lint status: 0 errors, a few non-blocking `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warnings remain for future tuning
  - Test status: 50 files, 559 tests passing

### Docs
- Updated local developer notes for deployment and housekeeping workflow

## [Latest] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Workout Mode Timer Bug**: Fixed rep-based exercises stopping after 1 rep in workout mode instead of continuing through all reps and sets
  - **Root Cause**: `startActualTimer` function was clearing `workoutMode` state for all exercises (standalone and workout), causing workout exercises to lose their rep/set tracking context
  - **Solution**: Modified timer state logic to preserve `workoutMode` during workout execution and only clear it for standalone exercises
  - **Impact**: Rep-based exercises in workouts now properly advance through all reps (e.g., 1→2→3→4→5) and sets, with rest periods between sets as designed
- **Fixed Rep-Based Exercise Set Progress Display**: Corrected inconsistency between progress bar and text display for completed sets
  - **Issue**: Progress bar showed completed sets while text showed current set number, causing user confusion
  - **Solution**: Updated text display logic to consistently show "X of Y sets completed" matching the progress bar behavior
  - **Impact**: Both progress indicators now accurately reflect the number of completed sets throughout the exercise
- **Fixed Missing Activity Log for Rep-Based Exercises**: Rep-based exercise completions are now properly logged to Activity Log
  - **Issue**: Standalone rep-based exercises (like Cat-Cow Stretch) weren't creating activity log entries upon completion
  - **Solution**: Added activity logging to the rep-based exercise completion branch with proper duration calculation and completion notes
  - **Impact**: All exercise completions now appear in Activity Log with duration and rep/set details

### Technical Changes
- **App.tsx**: Modified `startActualTimer` and countdown functions to preserve `workoutMode` state instead of clearing it unconditionally
  - Changed `workoutMode: undefined` to `workoutMode: prev.workoutMode || undefined`
  - Added debug logging to timer completion logic for workout mode troubleshooting
- **App.tsx**: Added activity logging for standalone rep-based exercise completion with duration calculation and descriptive notes
- **TimerPage.tsx**: Updated set progress text display logic to show completed sets consistently:
  - During rest: Shows `currentSet + 1` completed sets (correct)
  - Set complete but not resting: Shows `currentSet + 1` completed sets (correct)  
  - Working on current set: Shows `currentSet` completed sets (fixed from currentSet + 1)
- **Test Files**: Updated all rep-based exercise tests to match new "X of Y sets completed" format across multiple test files

### Added
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging for workout mode timer completion to help diagnose rep/set advancement issues
- **Rep-Based Exercise Completion Logging**: Added proper activity log creation for standalone rep-based exercises with calculated duration and completion details

## [Previous] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Fixed Milliseconds Display in Timer**: Time display now shows only whole seconds (e.g., "00:17") instead of decimal seconds (e.g., "00:17.313") across all timer modes
  - **Root Cause**: `formatTime` function was displaying raw decimal seconds without flooring to whole numbers
  - **Solution**: Added `Math.floor()` to seconds calculation in `formatTime` function to ensure clean time display
  - **Impact**: Affects all timer displays - standalone timers, workout mode, rest periods, and countdown timers
- **Improved Exercise Type Detection**: Fixed timer interval logic to correctly identify exercise type in workout mode context, ensuring time-based exercises use 1000ms intervals and rep-based exercises use 100ms intervals for smooth animation
- **Fixed Red Color Timer Display**: Corrected timer color logic to only show red color during countdown phase (when countdown time ≤ 10 seconds), not during normal exercise timing

### Technical Changes
- Updated `formatTime` function in TimerPage.tsx: Changed `const secs = seconds % 60;` to `const secs = Math.floor(seconds % 60);`
- Updated `startActualTimer` function in App.tsx to properly determine exercise type in workout mode by checking the current workout exercise instead of relying on `selectedExercise`
- Added dependency `exercises` to `startActualTimer` callback to ensure proper exercise type detection
- Enhanced timer color conditional logic in TimerPage.tsx to restrict red color to countdown phase only

### Added
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test coverage for time formatting fix
  - **Format Time Tests**: Validates Math.floor() fix for decimal seconds across multiple scenarios
  - **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests 59.999 seconds, minute boundaries, large values, NaN handling
  - **Workout Mode Tests**: Ensures proper time formatting in workout context and rest periods
  - **Countdown Tests**: Validates countdown timer formatting without decimals

## [Previous] - 2025-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critical Timer Bug**: Fixed smooth rep progress animation that only worked on first rep
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple timer interval creation points were using inconsistent timing logic
  - **Solution**: Created centralized `createTimerInterval` helper function for consistent timer behavior
  - **Fixed 6 Timer Creation Points**: Main timer start, rep advancement (standalone + workout), rest-to-next-set transitions (3 instances)
  - **Smooth Animation**: Rep-based exercises now use 100ms intervals with decimal seconds for smooth circular progress
  - **Performance**: Time-based exercises continue using 1000ms intervals for optimal performance

### Added
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Created focused test suites for recent changes
  - **Timer Logic Tests**: `smooth-rep-animation-unit.test.ts` - 8 passing tests for timer interval logic
  - **Icon Integration Tests**: `svg-icons-integration.test.tsx` - Tests for SVG icon consistency and theming
  - **Test Coverage**: Validates decimal seconds calculation, interval timing, and cleanup behavior

### Technical Improvements
- **Timer Helper Function**: `createTimerInterval(startTime, isForRepBasedExercise)` centralizes timer creation logic
- **Consistent Timing**: All rep-based exercise timers now use smooth 100ms intervals throughout all reps and sets
- **Code Deduplication**: Eliminated duplicate timer interval creation code across multiple locations

## [2025-08-02] - Icon System Conversion to Monotone SVG

### Changed
- **Icon System Overhaul**: Converted all emoji icons to consistent monotone SVG icons
  - **Navigation Consistency**: All icons now follow the same stroke-based design pattern as navigation icons
  - **Theme Responsiveness**: Icons properly adapt to light/dark mode with `text-current` color inheritance
  - **Professional Appearance**: Replaced emoji with scalable SVG icons for better visual consistency

### Added
